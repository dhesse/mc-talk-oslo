# Monte Carlo Methods

> Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class
> of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to
> obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness
> to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

# Monte Carlo Approximation of Pi

# A Little Theory

Instead of

$$E[f] = \int f(x) p(x) \mbox{d} x,$$

we calculate

$$\hat \mu_f = \frac 1 N \sum_i f(x_i),$$

with the $x_i$ distributed according to $p(x)$, i.e. $\mathcal{U}(-1,
1) \times \mathcal{U}(-1, 1)$ in our example.

# Why Do Monte Carlo on Spark?

- Spark is usually used to *process* large data quantities. We use it
  to **produce** data.
- Sometimes we need to repeat a simulation many times, scanning a
  *parameter space*.
    - Easy to parallelize.
- Spark provides.
    - Easy to use framework.
    - Reliability.
    - Availability.

# Modeling Traffic

# The Nagel-Schreckenberg Model


- Road with $N$ spots, $k$ occupied by cars.
- Discrete simulation time steps $t \rightarrow$ discrete speeds.
- Speed limit $v_{max}$ units.
- Simple rules:
    1) If going slower than $v_{max}$, accelerate by 1 unit.
    2) If getting too close to the car in front, decelerate by enough
        units to avoid a crash.
    3) With a given probability $p$, reduce the speed by 1 unit.
